// This file is voluntarily synchronized with Git and GitHub, and not included in the ".gitignore" file.
// This because, if in the future I will work again on this project on another machine, I will probably use VS Code IDE again and I will not have to remember how to configure these paths.
// On the VS Code IDE the Extension Pack for Java has been used from the marketplace.
