All these Java (JDK 21) versions (for all the above archs) are present in the "./Versions" directory out of the box, if the repository is cloned with git-lfs installed. Otherwise, you can download your needed Java version manually, or even better, directly (and automatically) grab and download only the Java version needed by your system running the "./compile.py" file with Python3.

Then you can compile and run the project manually or more simply use the "./compile.py" script running it with Python3 to automatically compile and run the project.
