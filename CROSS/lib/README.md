The gson lib is a Google's library to work with .json files.
It's used to load and store the data handled by the project on .json files.
Specifically, the users' data and the orders' data are stored / readed with them using gson.

The JLine lib is used to customize the terminal's behaviour to better handle the user's input in the client's CLI.
