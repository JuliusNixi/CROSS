## Java versions to use & GIT-LFS & helper Python script
Read the file inside "./Java/README.md" for all the informations. The Java version (Java JDK 21) to be used with the project is also stored inside this repo in "./Java/Versions" for various archs and os. This has been made to have the correct Java version ready to be used, without the need of search and download it manually (this could be a little bit tricky in the future when it will become old). But, since the .zip files are large, they violate the maximum file size allowed by GitHub. So the repo use [git-lfs](http://git-lfs.com). So, if you desire to download the repo with the Java versions inside, you must before install git-lfs, since it doesn't come out of the box with git. Follow the previous link to do it and then simply clone this repo. Otherwise, you can download the Java JDK 21 manually, some download links are present in "./Java/README.md". Alternatively, you can directly run the Python script "./Java/compile.py" to automatically grab only the Java version needed by your system, without installing git-lfs, obviously you will need Python3 installed.
